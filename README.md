# K8s-Anatomy
K8s-Anatomy is a project that models a microservices system as a living organism. Kubernetes forms the skeleton, while the Prometheus stack acts as a central nervous system that enables observation, pain responses (alerting), and autonomic reflexes (autoscaling) for a resilient, self-regulating system.
